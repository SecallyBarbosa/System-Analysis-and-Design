Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The purpose of this project is to better provide training for a student driver at their local Department of Motor Vehicles. Ian is an Information Tech Officer for the owner of DrivePass, Liam. They would like to provide online classes, on-the-road training, and some practice tests all per customer request.

What did you do particularly well?

I would say that I did best at simply understanding what was needed. Understanding the steps for each diagram was where I did best. Understanding what was needed for the client to be satisfied and what routes to take to acheive the customers needs was the most interesting and simple for me throughout this course.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I wish I did a little better on the diagrams themselves. I did not use proper shapes or colors to make it easier for a potential client, and myself, to read in the future or throughout the produciton of the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I simply took each one of their needs and brainstormed what would be best to the user. It is important to consider the user's needs because it can help you understand what is needed on your end to keep both the customer and user happy.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The first approach would be to listen to what the customer needs and then suggest what you think is best. A technique I would use that I learned in this course would be the use of diagrams. I think these are extremely helpful because it can provide clarity for both the user and the customer. It can also help the staff members creating the software.
